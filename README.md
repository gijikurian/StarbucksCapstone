  There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3 and above

Project Motivation

This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. This project helps to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. This can also use to predict spending nature based on the demographics. This study is part of course that are owned by Udacity. This README serves as a template for others to follow in creating their own project README files.

File Descriptions

  There is only jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the predictions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. This file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict successful transaction. Input data has been clearly marked in the notebook. 

Results

  The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
